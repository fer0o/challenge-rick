This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
For CSS style I used TailwindCSS (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
and for Icons I used React Icons (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) 
The information used for this challenge are for the Rick and Morty API  (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character)
The vercel deployed page for this challenge is (https://challenge-rick.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started
## Instalation
To install the project is necessary type on a terminal 
```bash
npm install
```
after install the projects you can run the project with 
```bash
npm run dev
# dev mode
npm run build && npm run start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Aditional Information
For this challenge only 2 buttons are functional the button in the index page with the name "ver Todos" this button are linked with the second page. disposicion, in this page the left arrow icon is used like a button to get back to index page.

## API information
To manage the api information I decided to use getStaticProps (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) to get the necessary information to render.
## Coments
This is the first time to use Typescript I think is similar in some parts from JS, but I need more time to study more about how to manage well the Interfaces that we can create on typescript.
I need to practice more to be better with TS.

Thanks for the time and I want to hear your feedback ðŸ˜Š
